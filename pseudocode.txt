# from raspberry pi to db? collecting from db?

import tensorflow as tf

# training - pigmentation

with tf.Session():
	# set up variables: total, weights (to be changed repeatedly)
	total = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([])
	weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([])
	
	# initialize variables from above
	tf.global_variables_initializer().run()


docker compose - install on VM
orchestrates containers, brings up containers

spin out docker container
tensorflow nastiness is in docker
local files - edit, ex: server.py that calls the docker container
 

docker-compose.yml
